GradebookPlus/Parser version 0.07
=================================

DESCRIPTION
Gradebook is a module useful for parsing Gradebook Plus text reports, 
a program used by many K-12 school districts.  Simply go to:

Reports->
Gradebook of entire Class->(check fancy report, catagory totals, and all grades)->
Save to disk.

The parser can then parse the contents of this file. Use it how you like;
I use it so teachers can put their grades online with minimal effort on
their part.  After parsing, you'll have access to everything that was in
the report.  See the pod for more details.
